## Code:
```bash
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4sGL8EO-91bGcun2ba_NlSJGL9q.dhjNyUDLyAjN0czW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$
```
## Learnings:
### 1) When we enter a line of text, it is divided into 2 parts:
Command: The first word entererd <br>
Arguments: Any subsequent text after the first word.
### 2) In the above code, 'hello' is the command and 'hackers' is an argument passed with it
