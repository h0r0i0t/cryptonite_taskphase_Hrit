# Explicit relative paths

## Thought Process
With the help of the provided example, I was able to invoke the path with ease.
  
## Code:
```bash
Connected!
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IZLLg3eSmEG7P5ua_TFSY2DJDHb.dBTN1QDLyAjN0czW}
```
## Learnings:
- '.' is an implicit entry the refers to the same directory
